Simple Banking Transactions API

A basic Spring Boot RESTful API that allows users to create accounts, transfer funds between accounts, and retrieve transaction history. This project uses an in-memory data store and demonstrates clean architecture with Controller, Service, and Repository layers.

Features:
- Create user accounts with an initial balance
- Transfer funds between accounts
- Retrieve transaction history for a specific account
- Input validation and error handling (e.g. invalid account, insufficient funds)
- DTOs for safe and clean data transfer
- Simple in-memory storage (no database required)
